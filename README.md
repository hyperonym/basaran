Basaran is an open-source alternative to the [OpenAI text completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create). It provides a compatible streaming API for your [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)-based [text generation models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation).

The open source community will eventually witness the [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) moment for large language models (LLMs), and Basaran is committed to becoming the [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) for LLMs. Basaran allows you to replace OpenAI's service with the latest open-source model to power your application [without modifying a single line of code](https://github.com/hyperonym/basaran/blob/master/README.md#openai-client-library).

The key features of Basaran are:

* Stream generation using various decoding strategies.
* Support both decoder-only and encoder-decoder models.
* Detokenizer that handles surrogates and whitespace.
* Multi-GPU support with optional 8-bit quantization.
* Real-time partial progress using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format).
* Compatible with OpenAI API and client libraries.
* Comes with a fancy web-based playground!

## Quick Start

### Installation

Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperonym/basaran/tags) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/hyperonym/packages?repo_name=basaran).

For GPU acceleration, you will need to install the [NVIDIA Driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html) and [NVIDIA Container Runtime](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).

Basaran's images can be used in three ways:

* **Run directly**: use `MODEL="user/repo"` to download a model from Hugging Face Hub on start.
* **Bundled**: create a new Dockerfile to [preload a public model](https://github.com/hyperonym/basaran/blob/master/deployments/bundles/bloomz-560m.Dockerfile) or [bundle a private model](https://github.com/hyperonym/basaran/blob/master/deployments/bundles/private.Dockerfile).
* **Bind mount**: mount a local model into the container and set `MODEL` to the corresponding path.

### Basic Usage

#### cURL

Basaran's HTTP request and response formats are consistent with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).

Take [text completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create) as an example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1/v1/completions \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "prompt": "once upon a time,",
    "echo": true
}'
```

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>

```json
{
    "id": "cmpl-e08c701b4ba032c09ef080e1",
    "object": "text_completion",
    "created": 1678003509,
    "model": "bigscience/bloomz-560m",
    "choices": [
        {
            "text": "once upon a time, the human being faces a complicated situation and he needs to find a new life.",
            "index": 0,
            "logprobs": null,
            "finish_reason": "length"
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 5,
        "completion_tokens": 21,
        "total_tokens": 26
    }
}
```
</details>

#### OpenAI Client Library

If your application is using [client libraries](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) provided by OpenAI, you will only need to set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_BASE` to the corresponding endpoint of Basaran:

```bash
OPENAI_API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1/v1" python your_app.py
```

The [examples](https://github.com/hyperonym/basaran/tree/master/examples) directory contains ready-to-run examples for using the Python library.
